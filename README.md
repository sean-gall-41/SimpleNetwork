SimpleNetwork - A Sandbox Neuronal Network Simulator
------------------------------------------------------

SimpleNetwork is a simple network built upon a conductance-based
model for each cell's activity. This is a pet project mostly for
my own exploration of conductance-based models in computational
neuroscience, and it does *not* aim to be a realistic model for
any particular brain area. This may be subject to change depending
upon what direction I wish to take the simulation.
